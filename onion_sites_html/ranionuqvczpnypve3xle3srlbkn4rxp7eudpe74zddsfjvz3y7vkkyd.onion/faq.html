<tbody><tr><th>Who Are You?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>We are a little group of people involved for more than 10 years
with cybersecurity and hacking underground.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>What Do You Sell?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>We sell a FUD customizable and already configured 
Ransomware
(x86 &amp; x64 for Windows computers) managed via an Onion C2 Dashboard 
with the aim in mind to show for "EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY" a 
Ransomware in action via an Onion
C2 Dashboard. Please don't use this Ransomware for illegal purposes. You
are the only responsable for your actions.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Do You Sell Source Code?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>No.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>After Purchasing Can I Change RANION's Binary BTC Price, Email, BTC Address And Other Settings?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Yes you can do this through RANION's C2 Dashboard in real-time for both Package #STANDARD and #PREMIUM and #ELITE.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<!--ranion-->
<tr><th>How RANION Ransomware Works?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>When you will execute <i>Ransomware.exe</i> it will encrypt any
configured file type within PC (looking for files on C-Z HDDs) using an AES
256 Key generated on-the-fly (AES Key will be each time different and it is NOT hardcoded)
that will be sent to your C2 Dashboard. When finished it will create some
README files (in different languages) and a main banner message that
will be showed to every Boot (providing details for payment to your Clients) and 
user's Desktop wallpaper will be changed with a new one.
RANION Ransomware doesn't destroy your PC by encrypting exe files. Exe files
will be not encrypted unless you want to do it.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Does RANION Ransomware Support Any Features?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Yes. RANION currently supports <i>Delayed Start</i>, <i>Delayed Encryption</i>, <i>Mutex</i>, <i>Task Manager Disabler</i>, 
<i>UAC Bypass</i>, <i>Desktop Wallpaper Changer<i> and <i>IP Tracking</i>.
Other features will be implemented in the next RANION releases.<p></p></i></i></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Why Do You Sell To Lower Prices?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Our aim is selling good pieces of software and raising security
awareness. We know many other sites that claim to sell similar products are
scam. We give the possibility to test our product to a lower price.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>What File Types Does RANION Ransomware Encrypt?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>These file types: ".wallet", ".txt", ".rtf", ".doc", 
".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx", ".odt", ".ods", ".pdf", 
".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", 
".bmp", ".csv", ".sql", ".mdb", ".db", ".accdb", ".sln", ".php", ".jsp",
 ".asp", ".aspx", ".html",
".htm", ".xml", ".psd", ".cs", ".java", ".cpp", ".cc", ".cxx", 
".zip", ".rar", ".pst", ".ost", ".eml", ".pab", ".oab", ".msg". You can 
request us other additional file types/extensions to encrypt for free.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>How Big Is The AES 256 Decryption Key?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>It is a 64 chars long uncrackable alphanumeric passphrase. Every
time the ransomware is executed it creates a new and unique AES key.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>How Can I Decrypt My Files?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Put the file <i>Decrypter.exe</i> on Desktop and execute it. Insert
the AES key used for encryption and wait some time.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Is RANION Ransomware FUD?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Keeping a piece of software always undetected is an hard thing to do. We try to do our best to keep RANION FUD 
or very near FUD. Our Ransomware results clean for 85% of AVs. For 15% it is recognised by some AVs like a potential 
unwanted program or showing some CRC Error. <u>Our mainly effort is keeping RANION undetected with the most common 
AVs (Windows Defender, Avast, AVG, Avira, Norton, Kaspersky, TrendMicro, McAfee, ESET, Panda Security and Malwarebytes)</u>.
 In any way you can buy a totally FUD+ version (where we add some tricks
 to improve FUD ratio) for packages #STANDARD, #PREMIUM and #ELITE. 
Remember if you want to 
keep your Ransomware FUD more time don't scan it with desktop AVs and 
don't send it to online AVs.<p>

<i>RANION (RaaS) 100% FUD with the most common AVs (2023)</i></p><p>

<i>RANION (RaaS) 95% FUD with the most common AVs (2022)</i></p><p>
</p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Can I Use My Own Crypter With RANION Ransomware?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Yes.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Do You Take Fees From My Clients?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Absolutly Not! We take NO other money from you. You pay us only the
price for the bought Package.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Is Your C2 Dashboard Free?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>We give you access to our "simple, secure and fast" Darknet C2 Dashboard with no javascript for free.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>What Data I Can See On RANION C2 Dashboard?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Computer ID, Username, OS Type, IP Address, Date, Number of Encrypted Files and AES decryption key for all Clients.<p></p></center></td></tr>

Package 
#TEST.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Do You Take Care Of My Privacy?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Yes, of course! We keep no logs on our Servers and we are an
onion/darknet service. We use secure-deletion mechanisms too.<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>My Subscription Was Suspended, Why?</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>Because you have infringed many times our TOS, for 
example: (a) by sending your unique RANION exe to online AVs; (b) by 
publishing our product on clearnet websites; 
(c) by flooding our mailbox with many junk emails without having 
purchased a package with "support"; etc.
<p></p></center></td></tr>

<tr><th>Paid Add-Ons:</th></tr>
<tr><td><center>- Dropper: RANION can download a program of yours (exe 
file) and execute it after encryption process ended. You can set a 
custom link through your own C2 Dashboard.<p>
- Clone: we'll provide you with a fresh FUD RANION copy using the same information as provided during setup.</p><p>
- FUD+: we'll add some tricks to improve FUD ratio for your own unique RANION stub.</p><p>
- Unkillable Process: unkillable process by default.</p><p>
